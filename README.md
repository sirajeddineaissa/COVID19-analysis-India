As of 23rd May 2020, India has witnessed 3720 deaths from 32 States and Union Territories, with a total of 123202 confirmed cases due to COVID-19. Globally the Data Scientists are using AI and machine learning to analyze, predict, and take safety measures against COVID-19 in India.

## Objective
We need a explore the COVID-19 situation in India and the world, and strong model that predicts how the virus could spread across India in the next 15 days.

## Tasks
1- Analyze the present condition in India

2- Scrape out the COVID-19 from websites

3- Figure out the death rate and cure rate per 100 across the affected states

4- Create different charts to visualize the following:

* The age group distribution of affected patients

* The total sample test that is done to date

* The growth rate of COVID-19 in top 15 states
* The top 10 States in each health facility

5- State-wise testing insight

6- ICMR testing centers in each state

7- Use Prophet to predict the confirmed cases in India

8- Use ARIMA to predict the confirmed cases in India

9- Compare the Indian COVID cases globally
